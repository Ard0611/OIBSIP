# OIBSIP
This Git repository contains web development projects developed during an internship with Oasis Infobyte.
In this internship, I was offered three levels each having 3 tasks respectively. I choose to work on level 2 in which I have to complete the following 3 tasks:
## Task1 - Calculator
This project showcases a simple yet functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.This project is aimed at creating a user-friendly calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## Task 2 - Tribute Page
My Tribute Page project is dedicated to the legendary Dr APJ Abdul Kalam! This page serves as a platform to celebrate the achievements and legacy of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, a visionary scientist and former President of India. The page is designed to provide essential information about his life journey, accomplishments, and inspirations.
## Task 3 - A Basic To-Do WebApp
The Basic To-Do List Web App allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. It provides an intuitive user interface to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the list.
